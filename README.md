## I recently completed the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge and I highly recommend it to others. 

My journey with AWS started a few weeks ago with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/">AWS Cloud Quest</a>. I really liked the hands-on teaching style of the game. I have always been a believer in learning through hands-on experience, and the Cloud Resume Challenge has allowed me to further develop my cloud and DevOps skills.

<a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/">The Cloud Resume Challenge</a> helps with that.

The challenge consists of two parts: building a website and creating a visitor counter API. The website must be hosted on S3 and distributed through CloudFront, while the visitor counter must utilize API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, and must be defined and deployed using infrastructure as code and GitHub Actions.

I started by creating the website, which I hosted on S3 and distributed through CloudFront. I also learned how to obtain a public TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager, which was a new experience for me. The next step was to set up automatic deployment using GitHub Actions, which was a great opportunity for me to learn about this tool.

The second part of the challenge, the visitor counter, required me to learn about the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). I had some prior experience with serverless applications, but I still learned a lot about SAM and its syntax. I also had to brush up on my JavaScript skills, which was a valuable experience.

Testing was another hurdle, but I was able to overcome it by learning about writing meaningful tests for Lambda functions. I plan on improving error handling and potentially defining the front end using infrastructure as code in the future. Overall, the Cloud Resume Challenge was a valuable learning experience that I would highly recommend to both beginners and experienced cloud architects.
